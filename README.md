"Scriba eBook Maker" is a project for building ebooks (in ePub, PDF, and zip formats) using contents already available in other formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, XML, etc.) both on the Web and in file systems. Scriba is a utility written in Java and has a command line interface. It can also be deployed as an enterprise service. Scriba also supports plugins that can be used to pre-process contents before they are inserted into the ebook. Basically, in order to use Scriba, a user just needs to create an XML descriptor file containing pointers (URLs) to the contents of the ebook under construction.

Scriba has been entirely developed by the IT Department of the Italian Senate and is released under the GPL3 open source license. Therefore, it is freely usable, modifiable, embeddable, and distributable as long as the Italian Senate is acknowledged as the author.

Scriba runs as an engine to make the EPUB version of many browsable legislative documents (http://www.senato.it/ebook).
